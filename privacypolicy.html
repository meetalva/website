					<h3 id="double-opt-in-and-logging">Double opt-in and logging</h3>
					<p>The registration for our newsletter takes place in a so-called double opt-in procedure. This means that you will receive
						an e-mail after registration, in which you will be asked to confirm your registration. This confirmation is necessary
						so that no one can log on with foreign e-mail addresses. The registrations for the newsletter are recorded in order to
						be able to prove the registration process according to legal requirements. Therefore we store the login and the confirmation
						time, as well as the IP address. Also, the changes to your data stored with the shipping service provider (MailChimp)
						are logged.</p>
					<h3 id="logon-data">Logon data</h3>
					<p>To subscribe to the newsletter, it is sufficient to provide your e-mail address. Optionally, we ask you to give a name
						in the newsletter for personal address.</p>
					<h3 id="newsletter-consent">Newsletter Consent</h3>
					<p>You will be asked to consent to the use of your personal data to receive our newsletter as follows:</p>
					<p>“By entering your e-mail address and clicking the button below, you confirm that you are 16 years or older. You agree that
						Alva (represented by SinnerSchrader Deutschland GmbH, Völckersstraße 38, 22765 Hamburg) will use the data and
						information provided by you in connection with the use of the newsletter to regularly send you information about Alva by e-mail. By clicking below, you agree that Alva may process your information in accordance with these terms.

					<h3 id="statistical-survey-and-analysis">Statistical survey and analysis</h3>
					<p>The newsletters contain a so-called “web-beacon”. A pixel-sized file retrieved from the server of the shipping service
						provider when the newsletter is opened. Within the framework of this call, technical information, such as information
						about the browser and your system, as well as your IP address and time of the call-up are collected. This information
						is used to technically improve the services based on the technical data or the target groups and their reading behavior
						by means of their polling points (which can be determined using the IP address) or the access times. Statistical surveys
						also include determining whether the newsletters are opened, when they are opened, and which links are clicked. This information
						can be assigned to individual newsletter recipients for technical reasons. It is, however, neither our endeavor, nor that
						of the shipping service provider, to observe individual users. The evaluations are much more useful for us to recognize
						the reading habits of our users and adapt our content to them or to send different content according to the interests
						of our users.</p>

					<p>We may process your personal data until you revoke your consent. You can cancel the receipt of our newsletter at any time,

					<p>For instructions to take this step, please refer to the confirmation e-mail and each newsletter.</p>
					<h2 id="link-to-third-parties">Link to third parties</h2>
					<h3 id="embedding-of-external-platforms">Embedding of external platforms</h3>
					<p>You will find links to other websites on this website, directly or indirectly by means of links. The legal basis for such
						processing is our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. We may process your personal data until
						our legitimate interest ceases to exist.</p>
					<p>We hereby expressly distance ourselves from all contents of these sites to which links are established and do not adopt
						these contents as our own. We do not have any influence on changes of the linked content. Our website may contain links
						to other providers’ websites, which are not covered by this data protection policy. To the extent that the use of websites
						of other providers involves the capture, processing and use of personal data, please refer to the data protection policy
						of the relevant provider.</p>
